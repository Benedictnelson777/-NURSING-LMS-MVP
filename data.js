                            <h3>Welcome to Human Anatomy</h3>
                            <p>Anatomy is the scientific study of the body's structures. Some of these structures are very small and can only be observed and analyzed with the assistance of a microscope, while others can readily be seen, manipulated, measured, and weighed.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Key Concepts</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Gross Anatomy:</strong> Study of the larger structures of the body, visible without the aid of magnification (from Greek "makros" meaning "large").</li>
                                <li><strong>Microscopic Anatomy:</strong> Study of structures that can be observed only with the use of a microscope or other magnification devices.</li>
                                <li><strong>Regional Anatomy:</strong> Study of the interrelationships of all structures in a specific body region, such as the abdomen.</li>
                                <li><strong>Systemic Anatomy:</strong> Study of the structures that make up a discrete body system, such as the muscular system.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Anatomical Position</h4>
                            <p>To increase precision, anatomists standardize the way in which they view the body. Just as maps are normally oriented with north at the top, the standard body "map," or <strong>anatomical position</strong>, is that of the body standing upright, with the feet at shoulder width and parallel, toes forward. The upper limbs are held out to each side, and the palms of the hands face forward.</p>

                            <p>The human body is organized at several levels, from the chemical and cellular levels to the tissue, organ, organ system, and organism levels.</p>

                            <h4>The Four Primary Tissue Types</h4>
                            <p>A tissue is a group of similar cells that likely share a common embryonic origin and function together. There are four broad categories of tissues in the human body:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Epithelial Tissue:</strong> Covers exterior surfaces of the body, lines internal cavities and passageways, and forms certain glands.</li>
                                <li><strong>Connective Tissue:</strong> Binds the cells and organs of the body together and performs many functions, including protection, support, and integration.</li>
                                <li><strong>Muscle Tissue:</strong> Excitale tissue responding to stimulation and contracting to provide movement (Skeletal, Smooth, Cardiac).</li>
                                <li><strong>Nervous Tissue:</strong> Excitable tissue capable of propagating electrochemical signals in the form of nerve impulses.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The development of nursing education, professional organizations (ANA, NLN), and licensure established nursing as a distinct profession.</p>
